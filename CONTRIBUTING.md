Hello there,

You want to contribute to algolia-indexing? Awesome!

Here are a few things you'd need to know.

## Tests

To run the tests, run `yarn run test` or `yarn run test:watch` for TDD.

## Lint

Run `yarn run lint` to lint all file

## Build

To build the lib, run `yarn run build`. It will create the compiled file in
`./build/index.js`.

## Release

To release a new version on npm, you need to run `npm run release` (it won't
work with yarn). This will build the file and then publish it.

## Quick debug

You can also run `yarn run run` (yeah, I know). To run `./run.js` which is
a debug file used for testing purpose.
